#BH 2nd Turtle Racing

#Import the turtle and random libraries at the beginning

import turtle
import random

#Create a game with 5 turtles, each a different color


Red_turtle = turtle.shape("turtle")
Orange_turtle = turtle.shape("turtle")
Yellow_turtle = turtle.shape("turtle")
Green_turtle = turtle.shape("turtle")
Indigo_turtle = turtle.shape("turtle")

#Use a loop to move turtles forward a random number of steps each round
#Clearly mark the finish line on the screen
#Announce the winner either on the turtle screen or in the terminal
#Make sure the turtles' movement and race logic are correctly implemented
#Use functions to organize code, e.g., one for setting up the race, one for moving turtles, and one for determining the winner
#Test the game to ensure it runs smoothly and correctly identifies the winner (minimum of 5 times)
#Commit and push your code to Github
